# Eulogy

## Overview
Goal setting requires being able to envision future achievements. Practical benefits of writing one’s own eulogy are:

* Better objectively evaluate one’s life
* Awareness of different-direction to stay-the-course
* Begin thinking of purpose and meaning in current activities

## Scenario
At a very (very) old age, you feel your life is complete. You begin to reflect on what you have achieved and are satisfied with the life you have lived. You want to share this story - in the form of an eulogy - with the people you leave behind.

## Exercise
