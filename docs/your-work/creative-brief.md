# Creative Brief

> Design without direction, is just for decoration.

## Overview
Understand briefs can be used to _do work_, and _also get work_. Both are vital to maintaining a clear(er) direction for designers, clients, and stakeholders. Points to remember:

* A template to address the services you provides
* A game plan for the How, Who, When, & How-Much?
* A “spark / job start / kick-off” to any project
